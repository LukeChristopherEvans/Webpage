# OUR R CLUB 

PieR^2 is a R club aimed at getting University of Reading students and staff into using R for their projects. We meet every month to share experiences, code, and to troubleshoot those pesky R problems. 

Summaries of the code and content used in these meetings will be posted to this website through RMarkdown and we also hope to post R blogs from ecologists using R in their research.

# THE NAME

The name (*pie . R . ^2*) represents 3 key aspects of the club:

* pie -  We eat pies 
* R   -  We do R programming
* ^2  -  It makes the same sound good
